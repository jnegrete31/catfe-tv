# Weather/Clock Overlay Test - 2026-01-29

The TV display now shows the weather and clock overlay in the top-right corner. The screenshot confirms:

- Weather widget displays 67°F with "Clear" condition and sun icon
- Clock shows 7:37 PM with date "Thu, Jan 29"
- Both widgets have semi-transparent dark background with backdrop blur
- Overlay is visible on the "Thank You" screen type (lavender/blue background)
- The overlay does not interfere with the main content
