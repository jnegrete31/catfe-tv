The Manus platform has a **"Develop Apps"** capability that enables mobile app development and publishing.

### iOS Publishing Process:
1. Open **Publish** in Manus
2. Switch to the **iOS** tab
3. Click **Create app**
4. Follow on-screen steps to create the app in Apple's system
5. Manus handles packaging and uploading to App Store Connect
6. TestFlight processes the build
7. Developer receives invitation email

### Requirements:
- Apple Developer account ($99/year)
- The project must be built with the "Develop Apps" capability

### Current Project Issue:
The current project was built with "web-db-user" template which is for web apps.
To publish to App Store, we may need to use the mobile app development capability.
